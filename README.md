# DO NOT USE

This repository is no longer maintained. We've decided to use [strimzi](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator) to manage Kafka as k8s custom resources, and consolidated all deployment configs into a single repo. See the new setup at [broadinstitute/dsp-ingest-deploy](https://github.com/broadinstitute/dsp-ingest-deploy).
